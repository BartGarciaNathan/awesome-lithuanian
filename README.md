## YouTube channels

* [Spoken Lithuanian](https://www.youtube.com/@spokenlithuanian7186/videos) - Great classes, the topics are not consecutive. New videos are being release. The author has a website, it might have a paid for class.
* [Lithuanian with Paulius](https://www.youtube.com/@LithuanianwithPaulius/videos) - Lithuanian Podcast, information about Lithuania and about learning the language. The author provides private lessons. Might be difficult to use for a begginer.
* [Lithuanian without subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/@Learnlithuaniannaturally/videos) - Naturally learning lithuaninan through simple and 'understandable' audio. Great option for listening practice for a begginer.
* [videomokykla](https://www.youtube.com/@videomokykla/videos) - Lithuanian classes, with a lot of order and structure. A lot more technical than other resourses, and with a large catalog of classes. Looks like there are no new videos posted in a while.
* [Words and Phrases audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT7btYmIl1s) - Long audio repeating words and phrases in Lithuanian and English.
* [Dainu Karusele TV](https://www.youtube.com/@DainuKaruseleTV) - Kids show, songs to learn numbers and basic words. A bit difficult for a total begginner, but useful once you have some vocabulary, as words in songs are said not too fast, sentences are simple and keywords are very repited offten. Writen text in video background tends to be in english, which helps a bit to contextualilze.
* [DÅ¾imba](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAjf-rSIfbPkvHcc9Q8Dgg) - Kids music. Not for a total begginner, but once you have some vocabulary its quite useful. I specially like Katinas Kukulis. Sentences are a bit less formal, and a good way to learn more 'spoken' language.
* [Vakaro Å¾vaigÅ¾delÄ—](https://www.youtube.com/@VakaroZvaigzdele/videos) - Shows for kids, good read stories with clear audio. In the [website](www.zvaigzdele.lt) there are some nice kids songs with clear lyrics, although no written lirycs.

## Online courses

* [Arqus European University  Alliance online class](https://arqus-alliance.eu/event/arqus-a1-online-lithuanian-course/) - Last year the class was from October to January, this year it has not been announced yet.
* [My Lithuanian Course A1 By  EU Academy](https://academy.europa.eu/courses/my-lithuanian-course-a1?lang=en) - Novice class, a one day length class.
* [Glossika Audio Class](https://ai.glossika.com/language/learn-lithuanian) - Learn by listening to phrases. The content is not free
* [Lingberries Lithuanian Course](https://www.debeselis.net/courses/lithuanian) - Notes from a class, very helpful but saddly the information is organized in a way that does not have a natural progression. Feels more like somones notes that got posted there. Still quite useful.

## Web Tools

* [Lithuanian Flash cards](https://flashcardo.com/lithuanian-flashcards/) - Different subjects, including the most common 1000 words, that can be learned in a flashcard system. There is a study mode, a random mode and a test mode. Most useful for me, each word has an audio of how to pronounce it properly in Lithuanian. Highly Recommended.
* [Lithuanian Goverment education website](https://ebiblioteka.mkp.emokykla.lt ) - Lithuanian Government e-school. Tons of great resources, although it might not be useful for a total beginner. There are some animated games, as well as Books in lithuanian PDF and MP3, so you can read and hear them.

## Books

* [Colloquial Lithuanian](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/colloquial/language/lithuanian.php) - Looks like more of an analytical view of the language. The audio is available in the linked website.  More of an exaplanation of the topic, with less excerices.
* [Glossika Introduction to Lithuanian Verbs, nouns](https://ai.glossika.com/free-download/glossika-introduction-to-lithuanian-verbs-nouns-and-indo-european-etymology) - Very analytical, interesting explanation but hard to follow as a learning guide. More of a cheatsheet
* [Introduction to Modern Lithuanian - Beguinners Lithuanian](https://archive.org/details/introduction-to-modern-lithuanian) - Very academic approach, great explanation about the sounds, about the positions of the tongue and mouth for palate sounds. The Lessons have vocabulary and exercises.
* [Lithuanian a Comprehensive Gramar](https://www.routledge.com/Lithuanian-A-Comprehensive-Grammar/Ramoniene-Pribusauskaite-Ramonaite-Vilkiene/p/book/9781138063617) - Analytica and enfasis in grammar. Not many excersises but tons of examples.

## Cool Lithuanian Git Repos
