A great source of information to learn and practice Lithuanian as a foreign language.

> This repository is not meant to gather every link or service available, but keep small and high quality resources. In short, those are my favourite places to learn and practice Lithuanian. :wink:

## YouTube channels

* [Spoken Lithuanian](https://www.youtube.com/@spokenlithuanian7186/videos) - Great classes, the topics are not consecutive. New videos are being release. The author has a website, it might have a paid for class.
* [Lithuanian with Paulius](https://www.youtube.com/@LithuanianwithPaulius/videos) - Lithuanian Podcast, information about Lithuania and about learning the language. The author provides private lessons. Might be difficult to use for a beginner.
* [Lithuanian without subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/@Learnlithuaniannaturally/videos) - Naturally learning lithuaninan through simple and 'understandable' audio. Great option for listening practice for a beginner.
* [videomokykla](https://www.youtube.com/@videomokykla/videos) - Lithuanian classes, with a lot of order and structure. A lot more technical than other resources, and with a large catalogue of classes. Looks like there are no new videos posted in a while.
* [Words and Phrases audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT7btYmIl1s) - Long audio repeating words and phrases in Lithuanian and English.
* [Dainu Karusele TV](https://www.youtube.com/@DainuKaruseleTV) - Kids show, songs to learn numbers and basic words. A bit difficult for a total beginner, but useful once you have some vocabulary, as words in songs are said not too fast, sentences are simple and keywords are repeated very often. Written text in video background tends to be in English, which helps a bit to contextualise.
* [DÅ¾imba](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAjf-rSIfbPkvHcc9Q8Dgg) - Kids music. Not for a total beginner, but once you have some vocabulary its quite useful. I specially like Katinas Kukulis. Sentences are a bit less formal, and a good way to learn more 'spoken' language.
* [Vakaro Å¾vaigÅ¾delÄ—](https://www.youtube.com/@VakaroZvaigzdele/videos) - Shows for kids, good read stories with clear audio. In the [website](www.zvaigzdele.lt) there are some nice kids songs with clear lyrics, although no written lyrics.

## Online courses

* [Arqus European University  Alliance online class](https://arqus-alliance.eu/event/arqus-a1-online-lithuanian-course/) - Last year the class was from October to January, this year it has not been announced yet.
* [My Lithuanian Course A1 By  EU Academy](https://academy.europa.eu/courses/my-lithuanian-course-a1?lang=en) - Novice class, a one day length class.
* [Glossika Audio Class](https://ai.glossika.com/language/learn-lithuanian) - Learn by listening to phrases. The content is not free
* [Lingberries Lithuanian Course](https://www.debeselis.net/courses/lithuanian) - Notes from a class, very helpful but sadly the information is organised in a way that does not have a natural progression. Feels more like someones notes that got posted there. Still quite useful.

## Web Tools

* [Lithuanian Flash cards](https://flashcardo.com/lithuanian-flashcards/) - Different subjects, including the most common 1000 words, that can be learned in a flashcard system. There is a study mode, a random mode and a test mode. Most useful for me, each word has an audio of how to pronounce it properly in Lithuanian. Highly Recommended.
* [Lithuanian Government education website](https://ebiblioteka.mkp.emokykla.lt ) - Lithuanian Government e-school. Tons of great resources, although it might not be useful for a total beginner. There are some animated games, as well as Books in Lithuanian PDF and MP3, so you can read and hear them.

## Books

* [Colloquial Lithuanian](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/colloquial/language/lithuanian.php) - Looks like more of an analytical view of the language. The audio is available in the linked website.  More of an explanation of the topic, with less exercises.
* [Glossika Introduction to Lithuanian Verbs, nouns](https://ai.glossika.com/free-download/glossika-introduction-to-lithuanian-verbs-nouns-and-indo-european-etymology) - Very analytical, interesting explanation but hard to follow as a learning guide. More of a cheat sheet.
* [Introduction to Modern Lithuanian - Beginners Lithuanian](https://archive.org/details/introduction-to-modern-lithuanian) - Very academic approach, great explanation about the sounds, about the positions of the tongue and mouth for palate sounds. The Lessons have vocabulary and exercises.
* [Lithuanian a Comprehensive Grammar](https://www.routledge.com/Lithuanian-A-Comprehensive-Grammar/Ramoniene-Pribusauskaite-Ramonaite-Vilkiene/p/book/9781138063617) - Analytic and emphasis in grammar. Not many exercises but tons of examples.

## Cool Lithuanian Git Repos

* [Awesome Lithuania](https://github.com/navidonskis/awesome-lithuania) - A curated list of things that show the awesome side of Lithuania.
* [Lithuanian_Flashcards](https://github.com/dainius-sileika/Lithuanian_Flashcards) - A Lithuanian Flashcard deck, for Anki, based on Fluent-Forever's 625 basic vocabulary items
