A great source of information to learn and practice Lithuanian as a foreign language.

## YouTube channels


* [Spoken Lithuanian](https://www.youtube.com/@spokenlithuanian7186/videos) - Great classes, the topics are not consecutive. New videos are being release. The author has a website, it might have a paid for class.
* [Lithuanian with Paulius](https://www.youtube.com/@LithuanianwithPaulius/videos) - Lithuanian Podcast, information about Lithuania and about learning the language. The author provides private lessons. Might be difficult to use for a begginer.
* [Lithuanian without subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/@Learnlithuaniannaturally/videos) - Naturally learning lithuaninan through simple and 'understandable' audio. Great option for listening practice for a begginer. 
* [videomokykla](https://www.youtube.com/@videomokykla/videos) - Lithuanian classes, with a lot of order and structure. A lot more technical than other resourses, and with a large catalog of classes. Looks like there are no new videos posted in a while.
* [Words and Phrases audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT7btYmIl1s) - Long audio repeating words and phrases in Lithuanian and English.
* [Dainu Karusele TV](https://www.youtube.com/@DainuKaruseleTV) - Kids show, songs to learn numbers and basic words. A bit difficult for a total begginner, but useful once you have some vocabulary, as words in songs are said not too fast, sentences are simple and keywords are very repited offten. Writen text in video background tends to be in english, which helps a bit to contextualilze. 
* [DÅ¾imba](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAjf-rSIfbPkvHcc9Q8Dgg) - Kids music. Not for a total begginner, but once you have some vocabulary its quite useful. I specially like Katinas Kukulis. Sentences are a bit less formal, and a good way to learn more 'spoken' language.
* [Vakaro Å¾vaigÅ¾delÄ—](https://www.youtube.com/@VakaroZvaigzdele/videos) - Shows for kids, good read stories with clear audio. In the [website](www.zvaigzdele.lt) there are some nice kids songs with clear lyrics, although no written lirycs.
